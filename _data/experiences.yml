  description: Developed a solution to fetch sensors data deployed under soil and save it to the database for the Low Cost Early Warning Solution for Landslide using Arduino and 12 geological sensors. The sensors are used to collect the data values of an amount of rainfall, soil moisture, and angle variations. The data collected from the sensor triplets placed in different locations are sent to the cloud server via GSM. Created a solution to predict landslide by using z-score of total collected soil movements data and send alert to people, using SMS-PP (Short Message Service, Point-to-Point) and SMS-CB (Short Message Service, Cell Broadcast) to pre-warn the people in the areas of increased risk of danger.
